# Storage

## Azure Container Storage

Azure Container Storage is a cloud-based volume management, deployment, and orchestration service built natively for containers. It integrates with Kubernetes, allowing you to provision persistent volumes dynamically and automatically to store data for stateful applications running on Kubernetes clusters. We can use Python to interact with Azure Blob Storage which is part of Azure Container Storage containers and objects.

## Azure Data Share

Azure Data Share enables organizations to securely share data with multiple customers and partners. Data providers are always in control of the data that they've shared and Azure Data Share makes it simple to manage and monitor what data was shared, when and by whom. Using Data Share, a data provider can share data and manage their shares all in one place. To use python with Azure Data Share, you can leverage Azure SDKs and libraries to interact with Azure Data Share services.

# Compute

## App Service

Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo. Azure provides SDKs for various services that allow you to interact with them programmatically. These SDKs can be used in a Python code running on Azure app service to interact with other Azure services like Azure storage, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Cognitive Services.

## Azure Spring Apps

Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Azure Spring Apps makes it easy to deploy Spring Boot applications to Azure without any code changes. The service manages the infrastructure of Spring applications so developers can focus on their code. Azure Spring Apps provides lifecycle management using comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, blue-green deployments, and more. Although primarily designed for Java applications, Python can be incorporated within the Spring application to interact with Python-based services or libraries.

# Databases

## Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring without user involvement. Azure SQL Database always runs on the latest stable version of the SQL Server database engine and patched OS with 99.99% availability. PaaS capabilities built into Azure SQL Database enable you to focus on the domain-specific database administration and optimization activities that are critical for your business. With Azure SQL Database, you can create a highly available and high-performance data storage layer for the applications and solutions in Azure. SQL Database can be the right choice for a variety of modern cloud applications because it enables you to process both relational data and nonrelational structures, such as graphs, JSON, spatial, and XML. Python can interact with an Azure SQL Database by querying data, updating records, or performing any other database-related task.

## Azure Database for MariaDB

Azure Database for MariaDB is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud. Azure Database for MariaDB delivers, built-in high availability with no additional cost, predictable performance, using inclusive pay-as-you-go pricing, scaling as needed within seconds, secured protection of sensitive data at rest and in motion, automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days and enterprise-grade security and compliance. These capabilities require almost no administration and are provided at no additional cost. Azure Database for MariaDB can help you rapidly develop your app and accelerate your time to market. Data can be pulled from MariaDB into Python for analytics. The insights extracted from this data are very good for decision making.
